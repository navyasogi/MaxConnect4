Evaluation Function:
Assuming Player 2  is maximizing, Player1 minimizing.
If Board is full, if Player 2 wins it returns a large value.
if player1 wins it return negaive of large value.
0 if it is a draw.

If depth limit is reached before board is full:
we give weighted values as follows.
Four 2's: Count*1000
Three 2's: Count*50
Two 2's: Count*10

Four 1's: -Count*1000
Three 1's: -Count*50
Two 1's: -Count*10

Threes and twos considered above are only those values which may 
result in a 4.
Eg: 1110 will be considered, as 1111 is possible.
    1112 will not be considered, as 1111 can never be formed.
